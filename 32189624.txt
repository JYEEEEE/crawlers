TI  - Anders Retzius and the Dental Histologists of the Mid-Nineteenth Century: Their
      Contribution to Comparative Anatomy, Histology and Anthropology.

AB  - Anatomy, comparative anatomy and embryology are fundamental to taxonomy and
      evolutionary biology. In the mid-nineteenth century many anatomists and
      zoologists made major contributions to more than one of these disciplines and a
      surprising number of them were also histologists. Historical accounts of
      discoveries and developments in anatomy, and in particular dental histology,
      rarely consider broader contributions and have tended to be concerned with
      establishing historical priority about who discovered or described what first.
      The period 1830 to 1840 saw new developments in light microscopy that enabled
      studies of histology, cellular pathology and embryology. It also saw a shift away
      from older ideas such as Naturphilosophie and vitalism towards a more rigorous
      experimental approach to scientific investigation. Many scientists with diverse
      research interests were working in parallel on comparative dental histology and
      were in many cases largely unaware of each other's work. One researcher, Anders
      Retzius, travelled widely across Europe, corresponded regularly with his
      scientific colleagues and, probably unbeknownst to himself in his own lifetime,
      made a lasting contribution to dental histology. Anders Retzius was a clinician, 
      an anatomist, a comparative anatomist, a histologist and latterly an
      anthropologist. His life and career spanned the whole of this fast-moving period 
      in the history of anatomy and histology.
